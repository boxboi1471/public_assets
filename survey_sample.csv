I asked him if he was aware of my issue (I was completely unable to get into my laptop and therefore, unable to work at all), and he was quite rude. He told me that he was there for this other employee and when he was done with her, he was headed to Lakewood. He did not even advise me to call the Help Desk again, and in my opinion, he was quite rude.  I gave up and came home. I kept checking the online ticket from my phone, and added several comments.

They acted friendly, and professional while on the call. They were upfront in expectations and advised that everything they attempted would not be successful. I would have preferred a recovery attempt while the computer hard drive was not actively in use, but this was not offered. I still believe recovery was possible, but the KP system is not set up to handle and execute recovery of files on a computer C drive. Prior to the recovery attempt on 1/6/2022, I spoke with 3 EUS support representatives on 1/5/2022, one lead EUS representative, and one senior manager. The first EUS representative advised he would ""look into backups"" and get back to me. I never spoke to him again. I attempted to reach out via Teams, and the ServiceNow messaging service and did not receive a response. The second EUS representative (I called back 2 hours later) spent 45-60 minutes on the phone with me attempting numerous avenues to possibly locate the files elsewhere on the C drive unsuccessfully. He also advised he would call me back and I didn't receive a response. The third EUS representative (I called back 2 hours later) blatantly told me the files were unrecoverable. That's when I finally spoke with a lead, a manager, and was put in touch with the two nice folks who assisted me on 1/6/2022 which I wrote nicely about at the beginning of this survey. Thank you for at least making an effort, although a knowingly unsuccessful one. I appreciate that.",2022-01-07 20:57:15,Kudo

I have no doubt my IT provider has diagnosed the problem correctly. Microsoft really needs to step up its game. Or maybe KP needs to allow access to KPLearns with Microsoft (Excel, Power Automate/Flow), because problems like these are debilitating. We cannot function, and we waste so much time troubleshooting. I'm so sick of these issues, but even our analyst didn't have any more recommendations. Hopefully the recommendations that this IT person gave will work. I'm certain it will help immensely. Microsoft apps are too slow and incompetent to meet our needs.",2022-01-12 20:49:12,Issue Not Resolved

It is exhausting and annoying that KP doesn't want to buy the highest levels of support for products like Microsoft Office. Because we have bandwidth problems with Teams and Excel, our WFH nurses have a lot of problems. It's really frustrating that MS Office cannot handle multiple users. It's so scary when our data disappears or converts into something else (all cells turned into dates?!). Thankfully IT was able to help guide me to previous versions (not in Teams, like the first IT person and I thought it would be), but in Excel. 
I think problems like this could be prevented by having more bandwidth or working memory for Teams/Excel. It also seems to be a problem more for people working from home, so maybe it is their slow internet, which could obviously be upgraded by KP anyway.
