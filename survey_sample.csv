I would have preferred a recovery attempt while the computer hard drive was not actively in use, but this was not offered. I still believe recovery was possible, but the KP system is not set up to handle and execute recovery of files on a computer C drive. Prior to the recovery attempt on 1/6/2022, I spoke with 3 EUS support representatives on 1/5/2022, one lead EUS representative, and one senior manager. The first EUS representative advised he would ""look into backups"" and get back to me. I never spoke to him again. I attempted to reach out via Teams, and the ServiceNow messaging service and did not receive a response. The second EUS representative (I called back 2 hours later) spent 45-60 minutes on the phone with me attempting numerous avenues to possibly locate the files elsewhere on the C drive unsuccessfully. He also advised he would call me back and I didn't receive a response. The third EUS representative (I called back 2 hours later) blatantly told me the files were unrecoverable. That's when I finally spoke with a lead, a manager, and was put in touch with the two nice folks who assisted me on 1/6/2022 which I wrote nicely about at the beginning of this survey.

Collectively, we were making  DAILY calls to tech support resulting in being on hold for more than 6 hours, the end result of which was escalating the ticket to an incident due to the request missing the SLA.  

Fortunately for us, Albert Li was eventually assigned the ticket.  He was helpful in keeping us informed with real information, and facilitated the escalation for securing a laptop for a new KP employee.

If you are asking if I would recommend the specific IT rep that assisted, the answer would be no.  He was rude and condescending.  He communicated as if I was in IT and there were certain things he assumed I knew, which I did not.  He gave me the impression I was bothering him and he would rather be doing something else.   Then he would be kind and more service-oriented, as if he started thinking he might be rated in a survey like this.

Also, unrelated to this event but during a service call inquiry.  The prompt gave me the option of getting a call back instead of waiting on hold.  I took that option and did not receive a call until 2.5 hours later (my estimated time to be on hold was 45-60 mins).  When I did get the call back, I was put on hold for almost 3 hours.  I stayed on the line purposely to see how long it would take to be connected to someone. When they did connect me, it was 4 minutes before I had to clock out of work.  The person on the line said it was busy.  However, I don't understand why I was called back to ""not lose my place in line"" over an hour when I was told, then get placed on hold for almost 3 more hours.  It was just bad service and far from ""simply the best""",2022-01-24 17:44:34,"Kudo,Time to Resolve,Not Resolved"

The service desk person promptly responded and was very helpful but the recovery code entered did not work, hence, a ticket was created for me. I gave my contact number and waited and waited until noon for a call but nothing came. Being a Monday, it was our busiest day and two managers were off that day. I had to  drive over to Pasadena after getting a loaner laptop from one of the managers. It was 2pm when I got there and it was only then did I see the IT's email at 10:40am. It did not make sense to me that he would email and not call when I could not even get my windows open. That's one whole day wasted! IT replied to my email the next day and was apologetic saying he only worked half day that day. I just wonder what protocol is observed when an IT had to leave work with tickets assigned to him that are open and no attempt at other forms of communication was made to the caller.

I think problems like this could be prevented by having more bandwidth or working memory for Teams/Excel.
